	add equivalence test to compare with "gold standard" from Guava

	From:
	https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/hash/HashingTest.java#L230

	And similar to:
	https://github.com/dgryski/go-jump/blob/master/jump_test.go#L30

	Thanks to Damian Gryski (@dgryski) for the suggestion.

	* tests/test_jumphash_equivalence.c: test "gold standard" values
	* Makefile.am: add test, remove valgrind target
