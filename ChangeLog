	API change: int32_t values changed to uint32_t.
	Allow the LCG multiplier to be set at runtime.
	It makes little sense to change the multiplier after the first call,
	thus no effort is made for thread safety.
	If thread-safety is needed, the caller can create mutex-guards
	in wrapper functions.

	* src/jumphash.h: int32->uint32; expose extern jumphash_lcg_multiplier
	* src/jumphash.c: int32->uint32; convert #define to uint64_t variable
	* tests/test_jumphash_rebucket.c: int32->uint32; setting LCG multiplier
	* tests/test_jumphash_equivalence.c: int32->uint32
	* Makefile.am: add test for alternative LCG multiplier
	* README: int32->uint32
	* configure.ac: bump version from 1.0.0-dev to 2.0.0-dev
	* misc/pre-tidy.patch: update

	add equivalence test to compare with "gold standard" from Guava

	From:
	https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava-tests/test/com/google/common/hash/HashingTest.java#L230

	And similar to:
	https://github.com/dgryski/go-jump/blob/master/jump_test.go#L30

	Thanks to Damian Gryski (@dgryski) for the suggestion.

	* tests/test_jumphash_equivalence.c: test "gold standard" values
	* Makefile.am: add test, remove valgrind target

	allow test_jumphash_rebucket to test resharding to fewer buckets
	rename 'test_jumphash' -> 'test_jumphash_rebucket'
	set license to LGPLv2.1 or later

	* tests/test_jumphash_rebucket.c: (renamed), allow reshard shrinking
	* tests/test_jumphash.c: renamed to test_jumphash_rebucket.c
	* COPYING: LGPLv2.1
	* src/jumphash.c: LGPLv2.1+
	* src/jumphash.h: LGPLv2.1+
	* README: LGPLv2.1+
	* COPYING.GPL3: removed
